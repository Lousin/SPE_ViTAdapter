**SATELLITE POSE ESTIMATION WITH VISION TRANSFORMERS**

Instructions:
- Create a folder named `datasets` into the folder `code`
- Download the speed dataset and put it in the folder `datasets`
- Modify `config.py` with the desired configurations, including the desired model and either training or evaluation mode. The pre-trained models are available in the `models` folder.
- from the folder `src` run `python main.py`
